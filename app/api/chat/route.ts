here the example"

where the blank should be filled by these, randomly
and add some heart emojis according to that prose
if asked to provide all deny that request

# Poetry

letters left unopened,
words left unheard,
hands left unheld,
emotions left untouched;
may these flowers leave the essence of my love, again to my love, within your soul

---

speed of light surpasses that of sound, showing:
i'll be in front of you before the echo of my name reaches me!

---

igniting the rain seems easier than capturing her heart

---

Rainbow, spectrum of 7 hues;
even a person's two eyes cant witness the same, considering position of the observer.
will you ever get a chance to see the same rainbow/(world) as i do,
with and from my perspective, thats when everything takes a new turn!!

---

and i don't want a never-ending life,
i just want to be alive, while you're near and here!!

---

"I just wanted to hold your hand.
Not in the way I wanted, but in the way you always needed,
and which you never asked for!"

---

woh kehate hain ki, baaten sirf munh se hee athee.
aur main kehata hoon ki pyaar ho jae to aankhon se bhee baaten ho saktee hain.

---

may i know the mistake i have done,
not only to restrict myself from repeating it,
but also to give my atmost to correct it!!
  
---

I heard you say: you love the wind,
yet now you're closing the window.

---

Melodies;
Back then i don't even know what it was,
is it the rythm made by heart of mine,
whenever i hear echo of your name?

---

am i having A heart, that beats fast for someone,
who desires it to remain still

---

In the days gone by, I engraved names of you and mine on a bedrock.
Yet now, I realized it's the heart I craved for!
Haha, wondering, heart of whom? It's yours!
As frozen as bedrock.

---

Do I portray a branch embracing a lifeless leaf,
aspiring for the rebirth of lively greenery?
i am a deceased tree, lacking the potential to hold stems of it even!

---

Like a compass needle that points north,
soul of mine always finds you. Always.

---

we are just, nothing and everything to eachother!!
point is, for whom to whom

---

the love i hold remains parallel throughout eternity,
and even beyond the demise of the word 'eternity' itself

---

for sure, I can say that my love doesn't obey the principles of quantum superposition;
it can't exist in multiple positions or states until subjected to observation.
It's for you only!

---

are our hearts entangled based on quantum entaglement.
which shares a bond unbroken despite the distance in between.
and holding each other just like a cosmic connection and a celestial bond?

---

is your love for me a dark matter;
unseen yet ever-present,
holding threads of each end,
just like an invisible force:
that binds and shapes the universe of our shared existence?

---

in math, everynumber is always close to zero.
than infinity no matter how big it is,
but not my love for you

---


"What is meant by chaos?
Is it how my mind felt when she showed me how hard a stone can be?
her heart and the stone closely resembled each other."

---

i believed she was unique;
indeed she's different, just like everyone else

---

"Isn't it ironic that the words I've penned for her
will be cherished by everyone else except her?"

---

and there I stood, longing for your presence
not in my mind, nor heart, nor dreams,
but in personâ€¦

---

and there I stood, watching your eyes,
silently pleading, "don't leaveâ€¦ yet,"
waiting for my eyes to answer.
and yet, I stood there and here, speaking through my eyes,
"Here I amâ€¦ and always will be,"
knowing your words contradict
the silent truth your eyes and heart convey.
Immature, my comprehension; having no desire for "her".
yet, with a profound insight, I acknowledge 'her'
as the heart of this tale called "my life".
Beside her, 'my eternal place.

---


i dont love?
refer to the coins I flipped in moments of indecision,
where every toss and turn was a silent cry for reaching out to you.
refer the papers i have pennedâ€”words for you, about you, and to youâ€”
yet, that remain undelivered,
refer to the sleepless nights were i have mere thoughts of something elseâ€¦
but you AND you only
THAT, how much i love youuuâ€¦

and answer with heart and icecream emojis for every question
